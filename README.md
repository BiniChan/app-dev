# FAVORITE MOVIE
My favorite movie of MCU is definitely the series named Agatha All Along which is an american television 
created series by Jac Schaeffer that is based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Agatha Harkness.

## WHY IS IT MY FAVORITE?
I love watching movies/series that has **super power** and **action** in their storyline. After I've watched
the **Avengers: Age of Ultron,** I saw Wanda Maximoff there and makes the movie more interesting. After that movie,
I saw her in any other movies of Marvels until they created the WandaVision series *(which is one of my favorite also)*
and then the sequel of the series which is the **Agatha All Along**. My favorite quote of the series is definitely
what Lilia Calderu said...
> "I love being a witch." - Lilia Calderu
